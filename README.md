# Spatial Transcriptomics: Mapping Visium and Xenium Data
## Automated Image Registration and Application of External Cell Segmentation Models

This repository contains the relevant notebooks used to complete my Fall 2023 Senior Independant Work (IW). My IW aimed to automate the image registration process between Xenium and Visium Tissue H&E images to produce a mapping between the two datasets, which will assit in filling in sparse data. Additionally, my IW aimed to experiment with other cell segmentation models on the Xenium H&E image to further define cell boundaries.
