# Spatial Transcriptomics: Mapping Visium and Xenium Data
## Automated Image Registration and Application of External Cell Segmentation Models

This repository contains the relevant notebooks used to complete my Fall 2023 Senior Independant Work (IW). My IW aimed to automate the image registration process between Xenium and Visium Tissue H&E images to produce a mapping between the two datasets, which will assit in filling in sparse data. Additionally, my IW aimed to experiment with other cell segmentation models on the Xenium H&E image to further define cell boundaries. 

### References and Adapted Code
- The cellcutter repository is pipelined to in this project and the provided demo was adapted in order to setup the model's pipeline with the relevant data.
- Tutorials from 10x genomics were referenced in respect to learning how to access the information in the given output files and how to process the data given its structure.
